# <b>Hey, I'm Paski</b> üëã
The most important about me is that I'm a full-stack developer and I love it. Also I'm a blockchain enthusiast, so if there's a chance to use this tech, I'll do it. I can handle any problems that could came out and I love to search for solutions (also I like to create new solutions).

There is a Tech Stack that I love. I'll show you my favourite, but I really don't care to use another one for a specific project.

## <b>My tech Stack</b>
I must say I love to work with different OS, but for my Apps, normally I prefer to use Ubuntu Server.

But I can use also Alma Linux, Debian or even OpenSUSE. You're going to agree with me that ArchLinux is the best Desktop OS but for server is pretty insecure.

### <b>‚ú® The chosen one</b>
- <b>Frontend: </b>HTML, CSS, JS (React/NextJS, ThreeJS, ChartJS)
- <b>Backend: </b>Rust (RocketRS, Tauri)
- <b>Database: </b>MongoDB or PostgreSQL

#### <b>For websites</b>
I love to use Strapi + AstroJS (or AstroBuild), with these the website is so fast to develop.

### <b>üéÅ The alternative</b>
- <b>Frontend: </b>Dart/Flutter
- <b>Backend: </b>Dart/Flutter, NodeJS
- <b>Database: </b>MongoDB or SQLite

### <b>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The other one</b>
- <b>Frontend: </b>HTML, CSS, JS (React/NextJS)
- <b>Backend: </b>Elixir (Phoenix) and GraphQL
- <b>Database: </b>MongoDB or Redis

These are my favourite tech stacks. Just enjoy.

## <b>Check other projects from my Gitlab</b>
These are other projects I have outside from Github, preferably on Gitlab. Why?? Well I don't want to give github all my projects. They can close or suspend access to my account when they want, like it happened before to the creator of npm. This is one reason but are many more.

### Developing a React made site
This is a project where I showed my client some designs, about how will the site work and the system works. This web is so different in his sector, that he was so shocked and impressed how worked. This was 7 months of work, with so many troubles and React version updates. Well here's the result.
