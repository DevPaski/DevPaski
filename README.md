The most important about me is that I'm a full-stack developer and I love it. Also I'm a blockchain enthusiast, so if there's a chance to use this tech, I'll do it. I can handle any problems that could came out and I love to search for solutions (also I like to create new solutions).

There is a Tech Stack that I love. I'll show you my favourite, but I really don't care to use another one for a specific project.

## <b>My tech Stack</b>
I must say I love to work with different OS, but for my Apps, normally I prefer to use Ubuntu Server.

But I can use also Alma Linux, Debian or even OpenSUSE. You're going to agree with me that ArchLinux is the best Desktop OS but for server is pretty insecure.

### <b>‚ú® The chosen one</b>
- <b>Frontend: </b>HTML, CSS, JS (React/NextJS, ThreeJS, ChartJS)
- <b>Backend: </b>Rust (RocketRS)
- <b>Database: </b>MongoDB or PostgreSQL

#### <b>For websites</b>
I love to use Strapi + AstroJS (or AstroBuild), with these the website is so fast to develop.

### <b>üéÅ The alternative</b>
- <b>Frontend: </b>Dart/Flutter
- <b>Backend: </b>Dart/Flutter, NodeJS
- <b>Database: </b>MongoDB or SQLite

### <b>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The other one</b>
- <b>Frontend: </b>HTML, CSS, JS (React/NextJS)
- <b>Backend: </b>Elixir (Phoenix) and GraphQL
- <b>Database: </b>MongoDB or Redis

These are my favourite tech stacks. Just enjoy.
