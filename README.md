# <b>üëã Hey, I'm Paski</b>
The most important about me is that I'm a full-stack developer and I love it. Also I'm a blockchain enthusiast, so if there's a chance to use this tech, I'll do it. I can handle any problems that could came out and I love to search for solutions (also I like to create new solutions).

There is a Tech Stack that I love. I'll show you my favourite, but I really don't care to use another one for a specific project.

## <b>üíª My Tech Stack</b>
I must say I love to work with different OS, but for my Apps, normally I prefer to use [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/server).

But I can use also [Alma Linux](https://almalinux.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) or even [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/). You're going to agree with me that ArchLinux is the best Desktop OS but for server is pretty insecure.

### <b>‚ú® The chosen one</b>
- <b>Frontend: </b>HTML, CSS, JS ([React](https://react.dev/)/[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/))
- <b>Backend: </b>[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Go](https://go.dev/) (depends on project and server)
- <b>Database: </b>[CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (depends on project and server)
- <b>CMS: </b> [PayloadJS](https://payloadcms.com/) (blazingly fast)
- <b>Website Engine: </b> [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

- <b>App development: </b> [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/) or [Dart](https://dart.dev/) ([Flutter](https://flutter.dev/))

#### <b>üåç For Websites</b>
I love to use [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/) + [Astro](https://astro.build/), with these the website is so fast to develop. If you're familiar with NodeJS, you can try to use the SSR (Server Side Rendering) function for AstroJS to improve the loads of the website, instead of the default usage for AstroJS related to Static Site Generation.

## <b>üìÅ Projects</b>
I've resestructurized where to upload my academic projects and my own so:
